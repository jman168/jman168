# Electric Skateboard
![Electric Skateboard Image](../assets/skateboard.jpg)
I built the skateboard to get around campus at UF. It is powered by a single 24V Kobalt tool battery (two are pictured here but this was an older version) as they are cheap, easily accessible, and offer good protection features. It uses a single REV Robotics Spark Max ESC and a REV Robotics NEO motor in a single belt driven wheel configuration; this configuration provides about 1000 watts of peak power and a top speed of 30 miles per hour. The Spark Max ESC is a powerful brushless ESC used primally in FRC but I decided to try to reverse engineer it's CAN network protocol and control it with an ESP8266 and I was successful. I plan on uploading the full reverse engineered non-FRC protocol soon as well as possibly a small header only c library for using it. Perhaps the coolest part is that all parts in the skateboard are standard off the shelf components or 3D printable by a standard FDM printer so I can get replacement parts very easily wherever I go. It uses a small rechargeable 3D printed handheld trigger style remote also using an ESP8266 with a small OLED screen. Everything communicates over ESP-NOW as it's easy, fast, and reliable. I also plan on upgrading the ESP8266s to ESP32s so I can have bluetooth support for things like locking and unlocking, tracking trips, and getting battery life estimates from a smart phone.
