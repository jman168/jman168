# Electric Skateboard
![Electric Skateboard Image](../assets/skateboard.jpg)
I built the skateboard to get around campus at UF. It is powered by a single 24V Kobalt tool battery (two are pictured here but this was an older version) as they are cheap, easily accessible, and offer good protection features. It uses a single REV Robotics Spark Max ESC and a REV Robotics NEO motor in a single belt driven wheel configuration; this configuration provides about 1000 watts of peak power and a top speed of 30 miles per hour. The Spark Max ESC is a powerful brushless ESC used primally in FRC but I decided to try to reverse engineer it's CAN network protocol and control it with an ESP8266 and I was successful. I plan on uploading the full reverse engineered non-FRC protocol soon as well as possibly a small header only c library for using it. Perhaps the coolest part is that all parts in the skateboard are standard off the shelf components or 3D printable by a standard FDM printer so I can get replacement parts very easily wherever I go. It uses a small rechargeable 3D printed handheld trigger style remote also using an ESP8266 with a small OLED screen. Everything communicates over ESP-NOW as it's easy, fast, and reliable. I also plan on upgrading the ESP8266s to ESP32s so I can have bluetooth support for things like locking and unlocking, tracking trips, and getting battery life estimates from a smart phone.

NOTE: the implementation of the Spark Max's CAN protocol is not included as I have not reached out to REV to make sure they are okay with it. I respect REV as a company and understand they keep their protocol closed for reasons outside of their control and releasing it publicly might cause them some issues. As far as I'm aware it should be okay, but I am unsure so I'm playing it safe.
