I'm a student at the University of Florida (go gators üêä!) currently studying computer science and specializing in embedded systems.
I'm a FIRST FRC alumni (go team 3627!) as well as currently being the firmware lead on the UF Formula SAE team (go GMS!).

# My Projects
I've done many things but some of the notable ones include my [electric skateboard](projects/skateboard.md), light up jacket, a utility to help with theatrical sound on Behringer X32 series consoles, the Vehicle Control Unit firmware for the UF FSAE team, and build infrastructures for Raspberry Pi, RP2040, and STM32 for the FSAE team.
